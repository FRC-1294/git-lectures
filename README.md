# Introduction to Git commands

## Prerequisites

Using Git commands to work with code repositories and collaborate with others is [arguably the more productive way](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/7pet4i/github_desktop_vs_cli/) 
than using GUI tools like GitHub Desktop. 

However working with Git commands requires basic familiarity with the command line (CLI). If you have not working with the CLI before, especially the Bash shell, please take an hour or two going through the lecture below:
